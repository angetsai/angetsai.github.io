		<div id="Intro">
			<p>Hey everyone! My name is Angel and I'm a senior in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. I am on the User Experience path and because I'm interested in design and how people respond and connect with interfaces. I am also part of Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan, the largest student org on campus that raises funds and awareness for pediatric rehabilitation therapies at C.S Mott Children's Hospital and Beaumont Children's. I believe in children and their strength, their joy, and their childhoods. Above are some photos from activities I had the opportunity to experience because of DMUM -- Mott's Summer Enrichment Camp and VictorThon.</p>
			<p>In addition to volunteering, I am also one of the Information Management Chairs for DMUM, along with Colleen Feola. Our team also includes three coordinators, and together, we maintain the official website and the database of Dancer information. We also like fun projects, like working with an outside developer to create a mobile application to be used in-event. #InfoManaged</p>

			<p><i>Question 2:</i> I looked at my site on Chrome, Safari, and Edge, but didn't notice any significant differences. The only thing that varied was the default zoom for each browser was set at different percentages, so the text and image sizes would vary.<br/>
			<i>Question 3:</i> When I click on both the form elements and the text fields, the boxes becomes outlined in blue and a blinking line also appears, indicating to the user that they can type there and that the text that shows up next to the form elements is being brought into focus. <br/>
			<i>Question 7:</i> After going through my code and fixing things from the first validation, I didn't find any remaining issues.</p>
